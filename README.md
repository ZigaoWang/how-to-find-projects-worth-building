# How to Find Projects Worth Building

*By Zigao Wang • August 16, 2025*

## The Real Talk

I've been through this loop too many times: ask AI for project ideas, get garbage like "smart toothbrush" or "weather app with dancing man." Here's what I've learned actually works for finding ideas worth building.

## Two Types of Good Ideas

**Cool Factor Ideas**: Start with "wouldn't it be cool if..." - these are the projects that make people go "wow, how did they do that?" Perfect when you want to build something impressive.

**Problem-Solving Ideas**: You actually need this thing. Like fixing slow WiFi at your dorm, making group projects less painful, or building a better budgeting app because existing ones are confusing. Both types are valid - just don't force it.

## The BS Detector

### Red Flags (Don't Build These)
- **Generic AI suggestions**: If ChatGPT gave you "smart toothbrush," it's probably boring
- **Already exists and works**: Do 5 minutes of research first
- **Forced practicality**: If you have to convince yourself it's useful, it's not

### Green Flags (Build These)
- **Natural idea**: It just popped into your head while doing something else
- **You're genuinely excited**: Not because it's "smart" but because it's cool
- **Solves your actual problem**: You'd use this yourself

## AI as a Thinking Partner

**Don't dismiss AI entirely** - it's terrible at generating ideas but decent as a critique partner. Use it to:
- Poke holes in your idea
- Ask "what could go wrong?"
- Challenge your assumptions
- Help refine your concept

**Try these prompts:**
- "What are the biggest flaws in this idea: [your idea]"
- "What would make someone NOT want to use this?"
- "What existing solutions am I competing with?"
- "What would be the hardest part to implement?"

Just don't let it come up with the original idea.

## Get Outside Perspective (Sometimes)

**For general tools, talk to people who aren't like you.** Your roommate, someone from a different major, your parents. They'll spot obvious flaws you missed and ask questions that matter. If you can't explain your idea simply to someone outside tech, it might be too complicated.

**For specialized tools** (dev tools, niche software), skip this - you know your audience better than they do.

## The One-Liner Test

**This is crucial.** Before you start building, write a simple description: "A [type] app that [does what] for [who]."

Examples:
- "A mobile app that splits restaurant bills instantly for friend groups"
- "A browser extension that blocks distracting websites during study hours for students"
- "A web app that tracks shared expenses for roommates"

If you can't write this clearly, your idea isn't clear enough yet.

## The Simple Test

Before building anything, ask yourself:

1. Am I actually excited about this? (Not just thinking it's a "good idea")
2. Has someone done this exact thing already? (Google it)
3. Did this idea come naturally or did I force it?
4. Would I stop scrolling if I saw this on social media?
5. Can I actually build this with my current skills?

## What Makes Ideas Actually Good

- Technical challenge that seems impossible but isn't
- Makes people feel smart or powerful when they use it
- Completely new way of doing something familiar
- Adapting solutions that work elsewhere to your local context
- Visually impressive or surprising
- Solves a real problem (doesn't have to be daily life)

## Final Reality Check

If you're trying to squeeze an idea out of your brain, stop. The best ideas come when you're not looking for them. Keep a notes app open and write down random thoughts. The projects that stick in your head for weeks are usually worth building.

Remember: ***if you have to convince yourself it's a good idea, it probably isn’t.***
